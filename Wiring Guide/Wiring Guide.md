1. Connecting the Power Supply:

Connect the three internal wires of a three-core cable (phase, neutral, and ground) to the power supply.

Although the ground connection is not strictly necessary, it is highly recommended as it protects against issues like shocks from poor insulation.

2. Connecting the Digital Temperature Controller to the Power Supply:

Connect the phase and neutral wires from one end of a two-core cable to the 220V input terminals of the power supply.

The other end of the cable will connect to the temperature controller.

3. Connecting the Motor Controller to the Power Supply:

Connect the phase and neutral wires from one end of another two-core cable to the 12V output terminals of the power supply (marked as V+ for positive and V- for negative).

The other end of the cable will connect to the motor speed controller.

4. Connections to the Motor Speed Controller:

Connect the positive and negative wires from the 12V output of the power supply to the input (IN) connector of the controller board.

For the output (OUT) connector, attach the positive and negative wires of another two-core cable leading to the motor.

The polarity of both connectors is specified on the bottom of the controller board.

5. Connecting the Motor:

Solder the positive and negative wires from the cable connected to the controller to the motor terminals.

The polarity does not matter, as it only affects the motorâ€™s rotation direction, which can be adjusted using the switch.

6. Connecting the Thermistor to the Temperature Controller:

Using the wiring diagram, connect the positive and negative wires of the thermistor to their respective terminals on the controller.

7. Connecting the Solid-State Relay Outputs to the Temperature Controller:

Connect one end of a phase wire and one end of a neutral wire to their respective terminals on the temperature controller.

The other ends of these wires will connect to the solid-state relay.

8. Powering the Temperature Controller:

The last connection for this component is the 220V power supply it receives from the main power supply.

The polarity is indicated in the electrical diagram.

9. Connections to the Solid-State Relay:

Connect the two power wires from the temperature controller to the lower terminals of the relay, observing the correct polarities.

For the upper terminals, connect the positive wire to a 12V output on the power supply and the negative wire to the other end of the heating cartridge.

10. Connections for the Heating Cartridge (Solid-State Relay):

Connect one wire of the heating cartridge to the upper negative terminal of the solid-state relay.

Connect the other wire to the 12V negative output of the power supply.

The connection order does not matter.

Follow these instructions carefully to complete the electrical connections of your machine. If you encounter any difficulties, consult the electrical diagram or revisit the steps to ensure all connections are secure and properly aligned.
